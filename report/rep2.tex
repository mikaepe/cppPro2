\subsubsection*{Task 1}
In this task we implemented the Taylor series for $\exp (x)$, that is 
\begin{equation*}
  \exp(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{n}}{n!}.
\end{equation*}
This was done by a straight-forward implementation of the 
sum which included all terms until the first term less than \texttt{tol}.
To validate our routine we check it against the exponential function from the 
standard library (i.e. \texttt{cmath}) for some values of $x$. 
The results are shown in Table \ref{TABtask1}.

      $x$. The tolerance used was set to \texttt{tol = 1e-10}.

\subsubsection*{Task 2}
In the second task we implemented the Taylor series for the exponential of a square matrix $A$, that is $\exp(A) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{A^{n}}{n!}$. 

To be able to compute the sum we implemented a class for square matrices. The class has as private members the dimension $m$ of the square matrix and $a$ which is a pointer to an array of pointers to arrays each containing a row of the matrix. 

We have the following constructors:
\begin{itemize}
\item Matrix(): the default constructor
\item Matrix(int mm): initializes a square matrix of dimension mm filled with zeros
\item Matrix(const Matrix \&M): the copy constructor which does a deep copy of the Matrix M
\end{itemize}
We also have a destructor which deletes $a$.

To be able to compute our sum we did the following operator overloadings: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Matrix \&operator=(const Matrix \&M): equates Matrix to M by deep copy
\item Matrix \&operator+=(const Matrix \&M): adds elements of M to matrix
\item Matrix \&operator*=(const Matrix \&M): performs matrix multiplication with matrix M and substitutes the original matrix with the new product
\item Matrix \&operator*=(const double d): performs multiplication with scalar d for each element in matrix
\item Matrix \&operator*(const Matrix \&M): performs matrix multiplication with matrix M and returns this as a new matrix
\end{itemize}

Finally we have some functions for our matrix class:
\begin{itemize}
\item void fillMatrix(double b[]): fills the matrix with the elements in b[] column wise
\item void makeMatrix(): prompts the user to fill the rows of the matrix
\item void identity(): transforms the matrix to an identity matrix
\item void printMatrix(): prints the matrix using std::cout
\item double norm(): computes and returns the infinity norm of the matrix
\end{itemize}

When we had implemented our class we computed the Taylor series similar to the implementation in task 1. We included all terms of the sum until the first term with a norm smaller than $tol$.

To validate our routine we check it against the provided routine, \verb|r8mat_expm1.cpp|. The results are shown in \ref{TABtask2}.
